Explanation
---------------
By examining the program, we see that the function expects an argv[1], and it
should have an even length. It then runs the string through a function that
converts it to some sort of bytes, compares it with some hardcoded series of
bytes, and then compares the two. So, I just need to figure out what the
function does, and give the right input so that it has the right output

It turns out that the function isn't that complicated. It goes through in some
methodical manner, assigning each character in our input to some random spot
in a duplicate array, after subtracting 0x20 from the char. It leaves the
length the same, and it's easy to tell which character corresponds with which
output.

The rest had little do with assembly, C, gdb, Ghidra, or anything else. I
could have been more analytical, but I just changed a number, saw where it
corresponded to, saw what it should have been, and updated it. Through that
process, and by finding the set of original characters, I figured out quickly
what the original string should be.

Now I'm going to go look at the source code with my hard-earned flag
