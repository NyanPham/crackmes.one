# this is my first solution, and I don't really know what you would want me to include here, #
# so I kinda explained the underlaying routine and what has to be done in order to archive   #
# the GOOD KEY message / routine                                                             #

the important stuff happens in the ".text" section
so after seeking to the begin of it and scrolling down a little you will 
see the first scanf() which follows shortly after where the "enter key:" message is being printed

if the program is being executed just via calling "./CNM" from the shell,
THE KEY WILL ALSO BE "./CNM" (yeah the exact same, seriously :P)

it will be checked via a strcmp(),   return value = 0  (strings are the same)    return value = 1  (strings differ)
to contine we want it to return 0   this can be archived by typing in what I mentioned above -> ./CNM

so after we did this , 4 additional scanf()'s will follow which all take an single character decimal value,
and then compare it to a fixed number embedded in the executeable, these are {1,7,8,5} in
the correct squence, so the user would have to type 1\n 7\n 8\n 5\n    \n stands for pressing the return key once,
so after each value the user has to press the return key, in order to seperate the values 

so if we simplify this section, it would like look like this:

                                                              V one value per scanf() call!

if( (what we got from the scanf()-->user given value), == {1,7,8,5})
    contine();
else
    fail();  //additional info: after we got the path key right, there will be no wrong key message anymore, even if one of the numbers is wrong

after ^ this comparision has ran 4 times (and all values were right) the good key message will be shown


so again the user would have to input the following:

./CNM   (if taking care of how/from where the executeable is being run)
1
7    (all the numbers one after another  --> one number per line!!)
8
5
