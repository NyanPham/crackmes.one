There is a stack based buffer overflow due to the use of scanf("%s") in the main() function.

To exploit this stack based buffer overflow, you are going to overwrite the entire stack and place a new return address so that when the program returns from main(), it will jump to the return address you specified.

Also ASLR must be disabled on the system for this exploit to work.

This is a simple buffer overflow but the fact it is 64-bit makes it just a little more tricky.

This simple python script will craft an input buffer.  Then you can run the binary using ./a.out < inp



from struct import *

f = open("inp" , "w")

f.write("A" * 184)
f.write(pack("<Q", 0x555555555640))
f.write("\n")
f.close()




Output of the program:

Rules: you don't have the right to modify the binary, crack this crackme as if it was on a remote server on which you don't have write permissions.
