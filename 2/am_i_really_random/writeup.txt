The string used for comparison with the input will use the path of the
executable file. That is, the first string of argc is used.

Therefore, the string to be input changes depending on whether you specify an
absolute path of a relative path at execution time.

In any case, the first, fourth and fifth characters of the string are used to
compare with the input.

if you enter a relative path and did not change the file name, the string used
for comparison with the input will be "c0ck".

if you enter an absolute path (this likely to happen unintentionally on gdb),
it is very environment dependent, but assuming you are running in your home
directory, in will be about "/0o*" (* will be a char such as the first
charactor of the username).

You can also change the string to compare by changing the file name.
For example, if you change "crackMe-by-m00ny-1" to "AAAAAAA-by-m00ny-1", the string will be "A0AA".
Keep thi file name long enough because there is a mechanism to check the
length of the file name.
