Solution is
dddddddddZ

Why?

Because the program reads the user input
Then checks that the length must be < 11 chars
Then it takes each char one by one and takes the ASCII number of each char
And adds them together
And checks that the result must be == 1000
Then prints out the flag using a for loop with exactly 10 iterations

This means the password must me 10 chars long
And that the ASCII sum must be = 1000
So you divide 1000 by 10
You find 100
And ASCII 100 is character "d"
So you put 10 "d", that's like 10 times 100 = 1000 right?
WRONG
Because you also type ENTER to submit your input
And ENTER is ASCII 10
If you submit 10 "d" + 1 ENTER you get 1010.
Not 1000
So, you need to have 9 "d", which gives 900
Then you know you will type ENTER which is 10, so now you are at 910.
This means the last 10th character has to be ASCII 90.
So that 910+90=1000
And what is ASCII 90? It's "Z".
So the answer is
9 "d" and 1 "z" and 1 ENTER
The sum of all of these ASCII characters = 1000
