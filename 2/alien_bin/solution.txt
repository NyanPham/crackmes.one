This is the solution to the alien_bin problem.

First of all, when you run the program, you can see that you need to type in a password of some kind. Typing in the incorrect password will print out the words "ERROR." When you deconstruct the program, you can see that the program prints out "ERROR" if the strcmp(value1, value2) returns anything but 0. The strcmp(value1, value2) function is used to see if two strings are equal to each other. Looking a little bit further up in the code, we can see that the first argument in the strcmp is created from the user's input, meaning that it is checking to see whether our input is equal to another string, and if it is not equal to that string, it willl print out "ERROR".

The second parameter for the strcmp() function was created in a loop. Since I was too lazy to reverse engineer the loop to figure out what the correct value was, I opened up a debugger, set a breakpoint right before the call to strcmp(), and checked the value of the rsi register, which was being used as the second parameter for strcmp(). The value of the rsi register pointed to a memory location with the following hex values: 62 64 32 33 63 66 33 66 35 36 62 61 61 38 36 62 63. Converting these values to ASCII gave me the following string: bd23cf3f56baa86bc. (Don't include the period). I used that string as my input for the password, and it worked.
