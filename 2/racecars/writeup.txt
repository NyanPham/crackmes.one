Hello all!! 
This is my first crackme writeup so please excuse me if the explanation is a bit bad.

Getting straight to the point:
ltrace, strace and strings did not provide anything valuable (I did notice "strlen" while running strings but that did not help it at all)
So I opened IDA and the whole graph made the thing very clear, here's my pseudo code which I figured out from the assembly dump.

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
   int start;
   int end;
   len = strlen(*argv)
   end = len-1;
   start = end;
   
   while((start-1)!= '/')
   {
   start = start-1;
   }
   
   while(True)
   {
       if(end<=start)
            {
                 puts("That's exactly what I want");
            }
       if(start ! = end)
            {
                 puts("Gimme what I want");
            }
   end = end-1;
   start = start+1;
   }
}
   
So, basically what the program does is 3 things:
1. It gets the length of argv[0] (which is exactly "./(program)"
2. It looks for the "/" character inside the argv[0]
3. If the characters on the left side of "/" (start) is greater than that of right side (end) it prints the flag message.

Putting a "/" between argv[0] means to run the program from a different directory, so I created a directory inside my crackme directory called it "ed" copied the program there and renamed it "r"
now when I ran it from my crackme directory like this:

root@anir:~/Documents/crackmes/CorC++/chillywilly# ./ed/r
That's exactly what I wanted!

Thank you again chillywilly for this one, enjoyed it! I hope to post more solutions from now on.
