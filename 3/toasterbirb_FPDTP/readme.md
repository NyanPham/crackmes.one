Alice and Bob are testing the new File Permission Data Transfer Protocol (FPDTP) for chatting purposes. Your task is to reverse engineer the protocol and create a program that can intercept the chat messages.

To start the chat session, run both binaries included in the zip archive (alice and bob). The chat log won't get printed out by either of the programs (its your job to intercept the traffic afterall).

Note: If the programs seem to get stuck for a long period of time, stop them and run bob before alice. The expected runtime is about 1.3 seconds when both binaries have been started.
