this challenge about understanding c++ sting class there is lots of string
allocation which might distract you. There couple of interesting global strings
there are two random strings zg2z8h4z2z and another "S5do7apOWcl``clx"
the second sting is the solution we should try to reach as its is compared to
the input, of course the input is xord before comparing multiple time.

understanding the xor sequence the help you to crack the solution. below python
code is the solution.

first i have translated the problem binary code to python code and then solution
python code.
<--------------code---------------->

incor_str = "Incorrect password, ganbatte kudasai!"
corr_str = "Your password is correct!"
key = "zg2z8h4z2z"
dest = "S5do7apOWcl``clx"
usr_inp = ""

def dcy(input_str, key):
    count = 0
    solu = ""
    for i in list(input_str):
        sol = chr(ord(i) ^ ord(key[count]))
        count += 1
        if count >= len(key):
            count = 0
        solu += sol
    return solu

# problem code translated to python

sol_1 = dcy(incor_str, key)
sol_2 = dcy(corr_str, key)
sol_3 = dcy(usr_inp, key)
sol_4 = dcy(sol_3, sol_2)


# solution
sol_1 = dcy(incor_str, key)
sol_2 = dcy(corr_str, key)
xx = dcy(sol_2, dest)
yy = dcy(sol_1,xx)
print(yy[:len(dest)])
