This x86-64 crackme presents you with two crypto challenges. One is easy, and the other requires more creativity. In both cases, you are asked not just to reverse engineer the binary, but also to break a leaky cryptographic algorithm.

In order for a solution to be considered valid, you must actually beat the challenges. Patching does not count, nor does obtaining the flag through other means. I've given you lots of time in case you come up with a brute-force type of solution. However, simple and fast solutions to both challenges are possible! Either way, I would love to see what you come up with, so please post solutions! Not in the comments, though.

Written in C, with parts written in assembler. Note, this challenge uses avx2 and rdrand instructions, so if your processor does not have these instructions you won't be able to run the crackme.

Enjoy!
